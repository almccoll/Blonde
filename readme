This is my read me file :)
And a revision

This code uses Processing 3.5.4 and the Java programming language.

The BLONDE_COVER_EDITED.pde file includes the code used to produce my project.
The Blonde.jpegg.jpeg file is the image that needs to be uploaded into the processing sketchbook so the code can use it.
The tear.png file also needs to be uploaded into the processing sketchbook so the code can use it.
The FRANK.mp3 file will also need to be uploaded into the processing sketchbook so the code can use it.

In order to use the mp3 file, you will need to go to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library and then search for the sound library.
Install this sound library and then the mp3 file will be able to play.

Once all is uploaded into the sketchbook and the library is downloaded, pless play and the animated image will appear.

You can interact with the text by hovering over it, try it out!

Once done exit the tab and stop running the code.

Thank you :)
